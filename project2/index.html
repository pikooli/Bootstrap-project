                        <p class="lead">The prehistory of the United States started with the arrival of Native Americans before 15,000 BC. 
                            Numerous indigenous cultures formed, and many disappeared before 1500. The arrival of Christopher Columbus in the year 1492 started the European colonization of the Americas. 
                            Most colonies were formed after 1600, and the early records and writings of John Winthrop make the United States the first nation whose most distant origins are fully recorded.[1] 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p> By the 1760s, the thirteen British colonies contained 2.5 million people along the Atlantic Coast east of the Appalachian Mountains. 
                            After defeating France, the British government imposed a series of taxes, including the Stamp Act of 1765, rejecting the colonists' constitutional argument that new taxes needed their approval. 
                            Resistance to these taxes, especially the Boston Tea Party in 1773, led to Parliament issuing punitive laws designed to end self-government in Massachusetts. 
                            Armed conflict began in 1775. In 1776, in Philadelphia, the Second Continental Congress declared the independence of the colonies as the United States. 
                            Led by General George Washington, it won the Revolutionary War with large support from France, and additional help from Spain[2] and the Netherlands.[3] 
                            The peace treaty of 1783 gave the land east of the Mississippi River (including portions of Canada but not Florida) to the new nation. 
                            The Articles of Confederation established a central government, but it was ineffectual at providing stability as it could not collect taxes and had no executive officer. 
                            A convention in 1787 wrote a new Constitution that was adopted in 1789. In 1791, a Bill of Rights was added to guarantee inalienable rights. 
                            With Washington as the first president and Alexander Hamilton his chief adviser, a strong central government was created. Purchase of the Louisiana Territory from France in 1803 doubled the size of the United States. 
                            A second and final war with Britain was fought in 1812, which solidified national pride.</p>
